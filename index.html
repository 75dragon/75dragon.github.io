      <h3>Fire Emblem Heros!</h3>
      <p>
        OwlHacks! My first hackathon at Foothill and an attempt to see how well I can replicate a complicated phone game. <br>
        Right before owlhacks commenced, a phone game called Fire Emblem Heros took me and a couple friends by storm. <br>
        It was one of those collect units, train them, and send them into 4v4 battles on a tiled world, using stratigy and advantages <br>
        to defeat the opposing team. However, they lacked a true PvP aspect (It was all vs CPU) and I wanted to solve this by re-creating <br>
        the game from scratch. <br>
        <br>
        I chose Java (because I was the most familiar with it) and decided to work by myself on the project. <br>
        The first day was remembering how to structure the basics of the project - I ended up having a <br>
        grid of buttons and changed them when charectors moved around the map. Next, we needed to add heros into<br>
        the game and make them able to move across the map. After clicking on a tile with a hero, the 2ct true/false would <br>
        tell you if the hero could access the tile or not. Then just press on the appropite button, and attack anything in <br>
        your weapon's range (1-2 tiles away) and thats the end of your turn!<br>
        <br>
        After everyone was able to move and attack (and deal 0 damage), The map was the next obstical to work on. In the origional game <br>
        there are preset maps, probably to add balance and make sure that none would give an unfair advantage. No smart coder want to do <br>
        all those preset maps, So I decided to randomly generate them. Lite green are plains, dark green are forests and Grey represents mountains. <br>
        this complicates movement, as players are divided into three main catagories and have different movement points on each type of terrain <br>
      </p>
      <table style="width:300px">
        <tr>
          <th>Unit Type</th>
          <th> Plains  </th>
          <th> forest  </th>
          <th>Mountain </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Infantry </td>
          <td>     1    </td>
          <td>     2    </td>
          <td>    N/A   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>  Mounted </td>
          <td>     1    </td>
          <td>    N/A    </td>
          <td>    N/A   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>  Flying  </td>
          <td>     1    </td>
          <td>     1    </td>
          <td>     1    </td>
       </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        well, thats cool and all and a lot of progress. But the whole game (and most others) revolve <br>
        around combat with all the other heros. And doing 0 damage will not suffice. After splitting the turn <br>
        into 3 steps (hero selection, movement, and attacking) I coded some of the numbers needed for the game. <br>
        sadly, combat is still mostly hard coded and defenitly a part I need to improve <br>
        <br>
        I came back to the game near the end of the summer, and wanted to clean up the game (those true false are ugly and <br>
        no one would no what they are for). So, to clarify the game, I decided to add tints to indicate where you could move <br>
        just like the origional - blue for moment, red for range <br>
        <br>
        With just this I was quite satisfied with the results - one day I might pick up the game again, there is still a lot to work <br>
        on such as adding more charectors, re-vamping the combat system (the code looks like a hack!) and making teams. <br>

      <h3>Vastness of the underground...</h3>
      <p>
        Once a high school senior final, made into a much bigger game!
        for our APCS final, we could basically do whatever we wanted in the span of time we were given. <br>
        This was the peak of my gamemaking carrier in high school, and I really wanted to do some sort of <br>
        cave/dungeon crawler like spluenky. <br>
        I quickly realized how hard it is to make a game with physics, so I instead made it top - down to help <br>
        shorten the time needed to complete the game. <br>
        <br>
        The first challenge is to make it appear on the map tiled, so a simple jframe/jpanel with a tile class showed <br>
        dark tiles on the screen. Thats already a good start, so I randomly generated some of the map to contain tiles at first <br>
        but realized that it was not realistic and needed a lot of improvement. Scrapping rng, I decided to instead start with all <br>
        black (unpassable) tiles,

        During the spring quarter of 2017, I was elected co-presedient of DeAnza's best CS club, Developers Guild!
        I also lead a group of CS enthusiats into a wild trip of learning jFrame and jPanels and how to animate a game on them!
